# Engine8bit
8 bit engine community engine made by a team in the Husky Coding Project HCP.
An engine built by a few UW Seattle community members. The aim of this project is to make an engine that would enable someone with little to no game programming
experience with a standard programming background to write 8 bit games with ease.
